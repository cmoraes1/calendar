# About: #
Users can register for an account and log in to see their calendar. Upon logging in, certain holidays are already included as recurring events. Users can add, edit, or delete events from their calendar. They can also share their events with other existing users. When adding an event, the user is required to choose a category (Work, Home, Travel, Other) associated with a color that classifies the event. These colors can be enabled or disabled according to the users preferences.
