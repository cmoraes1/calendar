### Share Event with User ###
When the user clicks on an event and then clicks on the "share" button, they can type in a username and share this event
with the chosen user. When that user logs in and views their calendar, the shared event will then appear and they can
edit/delete/share it if they would like. Additionally, if the currently logged in user is unsure of what other usernames
exist, the website displays a list of existing users that appears when the "share" button is clicked.

### Tag Event with Category ###
When the user creates an event, he/she must give it a category. Depending on the category, the event will have a different
background color corresponding to its type. The user can use the "enable" and "disable" buttons to enable/disable the tags 
in the calendar view. Users are also able to edit the type if they would like. 

### Create Recurring Events ###
When creating an event, the user selects whether or not they want the event to be recurring. If they say yes, then it will
appear annually on their calendar beginning from the year entered. Additionally, when a user logs in some recurring
holidays are already added to their calendar.
